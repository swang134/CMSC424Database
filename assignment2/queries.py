### 12. SQL "with" clause can be used to simplify queries. It essentially allows

### temporary table where, for 2000 elections, we are finding the maximum of the
### candidate votes for each county. Join this temporary table with the
### 'pres_county_returns' table to find the winner for each county. 
### This is unfortunately the easiest way to do this task.

### You don't need to fully understand what the 'temp' query does to do the join
